# Multi-Agent Testing Plan: Mech-Evolve Uninstall Feature

## Test Coordination Hub
**Created**: 2025-08-21
**Target**: Mech-Evolve uninstall functionality comprehensive testing
**Status**: ACTIVE

## Agent Deployment Strategy

### Agent 1: UnitTestingMaster
**Role**: Test individual components and functions
**Terminal**: Terminal 1
**Focus Areas**:
- Ignore pattern matching logic (`loadIgnorePatterns`, `shouldIgnoreFile`)
- CLI command parsing and validation
- File detection and classification (`listMechEvolveFiles`)
- Settings backup/restore functionality
- Pattern regex conversion accuracy

**Key Test Files**:
- `/Users/kefentse/dev_env/mech/mech-evolve/.mech-evolve-ignore`
- `/Users/kefentse/dev_env/mech/mech-evolve/mech-evolve-enhanced`

### Agent 2: IntegrationTestingChampion  
**Role**: Test complete workflows and user scenarios
**Terminal**: Terminal 2
**Focus Areas**:
- Full install â†’ uninstall â†’ reinstall cycles
- Uninstall with existing files present
- Uninstall with partial installations
- Interaction with existing Claude settings
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Agent 3: EdgeCaseTestingSentinel
**Role**: Test problematic scenarios and boundary conditions
**Terminal**: Terminal 3
**Focus Areas**:
- Missing directories and files
- Permission issues and access denied scenarios
- Corrupted settings files
- Non-standard file structures
- Complex ignore patterns with various file types
- Network failures during uninstall

### Agent 4: SafetyTestingGuardian
**Role**: Verify protective features and data preservation
**Terminal**: Terminal 4
**Focus Areas**:
- Confirm user files are NEVER removed
- Test settings backup functionality
- Verify ignore file patterns work correctly
- Test rollback scenarios
- Validate no data loss occurs

## Communication Protocol

### Status Updates
Each agent must update status using this format:
```
[TIMESTAMP] Agent-Name: STATUS - Brief description
```

### Task Assignment Tracking
- **Pending**: Task assigned but not started
- **In Progress**: Currently executing tests
- **Complete**: Tests finished with results
- **Blocked**: Cannot proceed, needs resolution

### Dependency Management
1. UnitTestingMaster starts immediately (no dependencies)
2. IntegrationTestingChampion waits for Unit Testing basic validation
3. EdgeCaseTestingSentinel can run in parallel with Integration
4. SafetyTestingGuardian runs after Unit Testing validates core safety

## Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Testing (UnitTestingMaster)
**Duration**: 10-15 minutes
**Deliverables**:
- Component function validation
- Ignore pattern matching tests
- CLI parsing verification
- Basic safety checks pass

### Phase 2: Workflow Testing (Parallel)
**Duration**: 20-30 minutes
**Agents**: IntegrationTestingChampion + EdgeCaseTestingSentinel
**Deliverables**:
- Complete workflow validation
- Edge case scenario results
- Error handling verification

### Phase 3: Safety Validation (SafetyTestingGuardian)
**Duration**: 15-20 minutes
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 complete
**Deliverables**:
- Data preservation confirmation
- Backup/restore validation
- Security verification

### Phase 4: Consolidation
**Duration**: 5-10 minutes
**All Agents**: Compile results and recommendations

## Agent Task Assignments

### UnitTestingMaster Tasks
- [ ] Test ignore pattern regex conversion
- [ ] Validate file detection logic
- [ ] Test CLI command parsing
- [ ] Verify settings backup creation
- [ ] Test pattern matching edge cases

### IntegrationTestingChampion Tasks
- [ ] Test clean install â†’ uninstall
- [ ] Test uninstall with existing Claude setup
- [ ] Test partial installation uninstall
- [ ] Test reinstall after uninstall
- [ ] Verify settings restoration

### EdgeCaseTestingSentinel Tasks
- [ ] Test with missing .claude directory
- [ ] Test with read-only files
- [ ] Test with corrupted ignore file
- [ ] Test with complex file hierarchies
- [ ] Test with symbolic links

### SafetyTestingGuardian Tasks
- [ ] Verify user source code preservation
- [ ] Test ignore pattern effectiveness
- [ ] Validate backup file creation
- [ ] Test rollback scenarios
- [ ] Confirm no unintended deletions

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success
- All unit tests pass
- Ignore patterns work correctly
- CLI commands parse properly
- Basic safety mechanisms verified

### Phase 2 Success  
- Complete workflows work end-to-end
- Edge cases handled gracefully
- Error messages are clear and helpful

### Phase 3 Success
- User data is NEVER removed
- Backups work correctly
- Rollback is possible
- Security is maintained

### Overall Success
- All agents report PASS status
- No critical issues identified
- Performance meets expectations
- Ready for production deployment

## Risk Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
1. **Data Loss**: User files accidentally removed
2. **Settings Corruption**: Claude settings broken
3. **Incomplete Removal**: Orphaned files remain
4. **Permission Issues**: Cannot access/modify files

### Mitigation Strategies
- Multiple validation layers in SafetyTestingGuardian
- Backup verification before any removal
- Dry-run testing with mock file systems
- Permission testing across different environments

## Reporting Structure

### Individual Agent Reports
Each agent creates: `{AgentName}_TEST_REPORT.md`

### Consolidated Report
Final report: `MECH_EVOLVE_UNINSTALL_TEST_RESULTS.md`

### Critical Issues
Immediate escalation for:
- Any data loss scenarios
- Settings corruption
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance degradation

## Agent Coordination Commands

### Start Testing
```bash
# Agent 1 - UnitTestingMaster
./mech-evolve-enhanced help  # Verify CLI works

# Agent 2 - IntegrationTestingChampion  
# Wait for Agent 1 basic validation

# Agent 3 - EdgeCaseTestingSentinel
# Run in parallel with Agent 2

# Agent 4 - SafetyTestingGuardian
# Wait for Agent 1 completion
```

### Status Monitoring
```bash
# Check testing progress
tail -f MULTI_AGENT_TESTING_PLAN.md

# Monitor individual agents
ls *_TEST_REPORT.md
```

### Emergency Stop
```bash
# If critical issue found
echo "CRITICAL ISSUE DETECTED - STOP ALL TESTING" >> MULTI_AGENT_TESTING_PLAN.md
```
