# Mech-Evolve Dynamic Agent Service

ðŸ¤– **Intelligent code evolution through dynamic agent creation**

## Quick Start
```bash
# Install in any project
curl -sSL http://evolve.mech.is/start | bash

# Check what agents were created for your project  
./mech-evolve agents

# See improvement suggestions
./mech-evolve suggestions
```

## Key Features
