# Mech-Evolve Uninstall Feature - Multi-Agent Coordination Plan

## Project Overview
**Objective**: Implement a robust uninstall/remove feature for mech-evolve that completely removes all installed components and configurations from user projects.

**Problem**: Current CLI only supports `on`, `off`, and `status` commands. No clean uninstall mechanism exists, requiring manual file cleanup.

**Solution**: Multi-agent coordinated implementation of `./mech-evolve remove` command with comprehensive cleanup.

- FAQ for uninstall process

## Coordination Protocols

### Communication Format
All agents will update this document with timestamped status reports:

```
[TIMESTAMP] [AGENT] [STATUS] - Brief description
Example: [2025-08-21 15:30] [ARCHITECT] [IN_PROGRESS] - Analyzing .claude directory structure
```

### Task Dependencies
```
ARCHITECT ‚Üí BUILDER ‚Üí VALIDATOR ‚Üí SCRIBE
     ‚Üì         ‚Üì         ‚Üì         ‚Üì
  Design ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Document
```

### Quality Gates
1. **Architecture Review**: Design must be approved before implementation
2. **Implementation Review**: Code must pass basic functionality tests
3. **Testing Validation**: All tests must pass before documentation
4. **Documentation Review**: Docs must be complete and accurate

## Installation Footprint Analysis

### Files Installed by evolve.mech.is/start
Based on CLI analysis, mech-evolve creates:

1. **CLI Tool**: `./mech-evolve` (executable script)
2. **Claude Directory Structure**:
   ```
   .claude/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ context-provider.cjs
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ evolve-hook-enhanced.cjs
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ evolve-hook.cjs
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project-id-manager.cjs
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent-context/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cache/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings-enhanced.json
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project.json
   ```

3. **Configuration Files**:
   - `.claude/settings-enhanced.json` (hook configurations)
   - `.claude/project.json` (application ID)

4. **Runtime Data**:
   - Agent cache files
   - Hook execution logs
   - Context provider data

### What Should NOT Be Removed
- User's existing `.claude/` files (if any existed before mech-evolve)
- User project files
- Git repository data
- Other development tools' configurations

## Safety Requirements

### Pre-Uninstall Checks
- [ ] Verify mech-evolve was actually installed
- [ ] Check for active processes using mech-evolve
- [ ] Backup important configurations
- [ ] Warn about data loss implications

### Safe Removal Process
- [ ] Disable hooks first (`off` command)
- [ ] Stop any running services
- [ ] Remove files in reverse installation order
- [ ] Verify complete cleanup
- [ ] Provide removal summary

### Error Recovery
- [ ] Graceful handling of permission errors
- [ ] Rollback capability for failed uninstalls
- [ ] Detailed error reporting
- [ ] Manual cleanup instructions as fallback
