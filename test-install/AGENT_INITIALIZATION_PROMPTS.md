```json
{
  "coordination_checkpoint": {
    "timestamp": "2025-08-20T14:30:00Z",
    "overall_progress": 0.68,
    "agent_status": {
      "architect": "completed",
      "builder": "in_progress", 
      "validator": "pending",
      "intelligence": "pending"
    },
    "blocking_issues": [],
    "next_milestone": "begin_ai_validation"
  }
}
```

### Conflict Resolution Protocol

2. **Impact Assessment**: Orchestrator evaluates downstream effects
3. **Resolution Strategy**: Collaborative problem-solving approach
4. **Implementation**: Coordinated fix execution across affected agents
5. **Validation**: Confirm resolution and resume normal operations

### Final Report Generation
Each agent contributes specialized findings to a comprehensive test report that includes:
